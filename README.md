# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Martin

I am primarily a contract software developer. At present, I prefer to work in Swift.

## ðŸ“± Mobile/iOS

Most of my work is native iOS, though I have worked professionally on both MacOS and tvOS projects. I started contracting in 2012.

I have also done quite a bit of professional work in Unity, (though I am no longer interested in that).

## ðŸŽ® Game development

I have worked on [a fair number of games](http://martingrider.name/bibliography.html) over the years, although I consider myself mostly a hobbyist at this point. 

I'm primarily interested in:
- ðŸ§© _action puzzle games_
- â™œ _tabletop games_ (especially _abstract strategy_)
- ðŸ¥½ _vr and ar_ games

I especially love games that cross genre boundaries or have interesting and new-to-me mechanics.

### Blither

My most recent game release was a mobile version of a 2-player abstract strategy game I designed called [Blither](http://abstractpuzzle.com/blither/). Blither was made in Swift for iOS. You can read more about the game in my introductory blog post, [Blither â€“ An Abstract Strategy Game](http://chesstris.com/2021/07/10/blither-an-abstract-strategy-game/).

### Thrive

Previous to Blither, I designed another 2-player abstract strategy game called Thrive. 
- Thrive was [published in physical form by Adams Apple Games](https://adamsapplegames.com/thrive/).
- I also released [Thrive for iOS and Android](http://abstractpuzzle.com/thrive/) made in Unity.
- I helped manage (and wrote a bit of code for) [Thrive's implementation on Board Game Arena](https://boardgamearena.com/gamepanel?game=thrive).

## âœ¨ Open Source

I'm very interested in open source projects for games, especially packages and projects written in Swift.

### Hexagon Grid Generator

I built an app called [Hexagon Grid Generator](https://github.com/mgrider/skhexgrid) initially as an example project for the excellent open source hexagon-drawing library, [hex-grid](https://github.com/fananek/hex-grid). It's built with SwiftUI and SpriteKit, runs on iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, and makes it easy to draw hexagonal grids. You can read more about it in my blog post, [Introducing the Hexagon Grid Generator](http://chesstris.com/2023/07/09/introducing-the-hexagon-grid-generator/).
